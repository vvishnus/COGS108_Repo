# Brief Arduino Code Explanation for Controlling a Continuous Rotation Servo Motor

## Code

```cpp
#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo;

void setup() {
  myservo.attach(9);
}

void loop() {
  myservo.write(0);    // maximum speed in one direction
  delay(2000);
  myservo.write(90);   // stop
  delay(2000);
  myservo.write(180);  // maximum speed in the other direction
  delay(2000);
  myservo.write(90);   // stop
  delay(2000);
}
```

## Explanation

- `#include <Servo.h>`: Servo library inclusion.
- `Servo myservo;`: Servo object creation.
- `myservo.attach(9);`: Servo object attached to pin 9.
- `myservo.write(0);`, `myservo.write(90);`, `myservo.write(180);`
   - :  Commands to control the servo's speed and direction. 
   - Exact values and behavior may vary between servo models.
- `delay(2000);`: 2 second pause to allow the servo to perform the action.

# Arduino Code Explanation for Controlling 180-degree Servo Motor

This guide explains an Arduino code designed for controlling a standard 180-degree servo motor.

## Code Overview

```cpp
#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo;
int pos = 0;

void setup() {
  myservo.attach(9);
}


void loop() {
  //First sweep from 0 step to final Position
  for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) {
    myservo.write(pos);
    
    //Every step takes place after 15ms
    delay(15);
  }
  
  // Then back to 0
  for (pos = 180; pos >= 0; pos -= 1) {
    myservo.write(pos);
    delay(15);
  }
}
```

## Line-by-Line Explanation

1. `#include <Servo.h>`: Includes the Servo library.

2. `Servo myservo;`: Creates a servo object from the Servo class.

3. `int pos = 0;`: Declares an integer variable `pos` to store the position of the servo motor.

4. Inside the `setup()` function:
    - `myservo.attach(9);`: Attaches the servo object to digital pin 9 on the Arduino board.

5. Inside the `loop()` function:
    - The first `for` loop increases the position from 0 to 180 degrees in steps of 1 degree.
        ```cpp
        for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) {
            myservo.write(pos);
            delay(15);
        }
        ```
    - The second `for` loop decreases the position from 180 back to 0 degrees
    - also in steps of 1 degree.
        ```cpp
        for (pos = 180; pos >= 0; pos -= 1) {
            myservo.write(pos);
            delay(15);
        }
        ```

6. `delay(15);`: Makes the Arduino wait for 15 milliseconds to give the servo motor time to reach the specified position.
